# Quant Interview Simulations
I enjoy solving quant interview problems with math.  

In an attempt to both verify my answers and improve my ability to simulate problems in Python and use Monte Carlo methods, I have written code for many of the problems I’ve encounter.

If you have any problems you’d like to add/challenge me with, please email them to me at timspurfan@gmail.com!

* Birthday Line
	* Where to be in line if you want to be the first to have a matching birthday with someone already on line

* Estimate Pi With Die
	* Use roll of die to estimate the value of pi to arbitrary precision

* Expected Backgammon
	* Find the expected value of a roll in backgammon

* Choosing of Balls
	* Find expected number of ball choosings before all balls are the same color
	* **difficult**

* Coin Toss Bankrupt
    * Find expected number of rounds of coin flips before someone goes bankrupt
	* *nice martingale solution*

* Expected Flips Until Sequence
	* Given a sequence of heads and tails, find the expected number of flips until the sequence occurs

* Expected Rolls Until All Six Numbers
	* Find the expected number of rolls until each of the six numbers has been rolled

* Conditional Expected Number of Heads
	* In 5 flips of a coin, given there are at least 3 heads, find the expected number of heads

* Expected Minimum Interval
	* Given n randomly selected numbers between 0 and 1, find the expected length of the minimum interval between two of the numbers

* Expected Minimum Value
	* Given n randomly selected numbers between 0 and 1, find the expected value of the minimum number

* Expected Value of Minimum Until Nondecreasing
	* Select numbers randomly from 0 to 1 until a number is not less than or equal to the previous number and find the expected value of the minimum number selected

* Expected Number of Draws Until Sum Greater Than 1
	* Find the expected number of draws needed for the sum of numbers randomly from 0 to 1 to exceed one.
