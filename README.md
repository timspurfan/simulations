# Quant Interview Simulations
I enjoy solving quant interview problems with math.  

In an attempt to both verify my answers and improve my ability to simulate problems in Python and use Monte Carlo methods, I have written code for many of the problems I’ve encounter.

If you have any problems you’d like to add/challenge me with, please email them to me at timspurfan@gmail.com!

These problems are gathered from a number of sources.  but the majority come from either:
	1. [CSE Blog](http://www.cseblog.com/), maintained by Pratik Poddar
	2.  [A Practical Guide To Quantitative Finance Interviews](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Guide-Quantitative-Finance-Interviews/dp/1438236662/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=150+quant&qid=1554940715&s=gateway&sr=8-3-spell), written by Xinfeng Zhou
